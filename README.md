# synge_reproducible
A repository capable of reproducing the results of the paper "Synthesis of Distributed Protocols by Enumeration Modulo Isomorphisms."
This code is still in development and it is not intended to be used for purposes other than reproducing the results of the paper.
A production build will eventually be made available.

This README assumes familiarity with the paper. In particular, we will reference Tables 1-6 of the paper and the results of Section 5 (Implementation and Evaluation) more generally.

arXiv version of the paper: **link**

The repository has two purposes, each captured in its own script file.

* Running experiments
* Tabulating results

Additionally, a frozen version of the raw data for the results as they appear in the paper is provided in **folder**.
